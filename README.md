Angular application that allows you to interact with a blockchain. You can see the blocks on chain, see transaction within them and even create new transactions and mine blocks.

Built on top of [SavjeeCoin](https://github.com/Savjee/SavjeeCoin) (simply Blockchain implementation in Javascript).

## üëÄ Live demo
**[Check it out here.](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1lckdYtUIdNTZ5WwhiXQmcBLyhuWyqI3d/view?usp=share_link)** You can create transactions, mine blocks and explore your own blockchain.

**[Check it out here.](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1LCH5IF2jt4gRI4_gk_c0oJkXNBt3RFgE/view?usp=share_link)** You can create transactions in main, mine blocks and explore your own blockchain.


## üì∏ Screenshots

**Creating new transactions:** You can create new transactions to any wallet for any amount (no validation). New transactions will be added to the "pending transactions", ready to be included in the next block.

**Pending transactinos:** List of all pending transactions. These will be included in the next block when the mining process starts.
